## About me
- 🎓 I am a Systems Engineering student, learning to build the future one line of code at a time.
- 🛠️ I love playing with any language available and I have a love-hate relationship with bugs 🐞.
- 🎨 Sometimes I feel like an artist when I write CSS (although the browser doesn't always agree).
- 🕹️ Gamer in my free time (and sometimes in the not so free time!).
